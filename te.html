Suhail</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p>This week, McDonald’s (<span class="ticker-hover-wrapper">NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD" title="McDonald's Corporation">MCD</a></span>) (<span class="ticker-hover-wrapper">NEOE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCDS:CA" title="McDonald's Corporation">MCDS:CA</a></span>) share prices reached a 5-year, and probably an all-time, high. And simultaneously, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of October, the US’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention announced that 49<span class="paywall-full-content"> people in Colorado and Nebraska have suffered from the E. coli bacteria after eating Quarter Pounder sandwiches at McDonald’s – including one death. This news sent the share price diving by 10% after the main market closed - although it recovered the following day to be done by only 5% by market close. The 5% discount is nice to have, but it does not tempt me yet to enter; valuation is too rich, and further discounts to the valuation would be needed.</span></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">Past E. coli outbreaks did break any restaurant businesses</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">E. coli outbreaks are neither common nor rare – over the past 40 years, they happened on average every 3-4 years on a noticeable scale in the US. Past cases have been limited to tens of infections rather than hundreds, and definitely not thousands. While any person falling ill is a case too many – these things tend to happen; food – whether in a restaurant or at home – will get infected every now and then.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">A relatively recent case was in August 2022 when <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/20/health/wendys-e-coli-outbreak/index.html" rel="nofollow">Wendy’s had an E. coli outbreak</a> that affected 84 people in four US states. The share price fell by a total of around 10% in the following 8 weeks, then recovered to close 20% higher by the end of that year. Almost all other major fast food chains have faced outbreaks in the past 40 years.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content"><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-company/who-we-are.html" rel="nofollow">With over 40,000 locations in 100 countries,</a> it is very impressive that outbreaks of food infections are that limited to McDonald’s.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">Performance is lackluster</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">McDonald’s has not published its Q3 results yet, but for a company like McDonald’s; quarterly results are unlikely to hide any fireworks. <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/investors/financial-information.html" rel="nofollow">In the second quarter,</a> total sales grew by a meager 1% globally, including a decline of 0.7% in the US market, while comparable sales fell by 1% globally. This was the first sales drop since 2020, and management blamed it on rising prices; the price of a Big Mac Meal increased by a third since 2019. This might not seem much over a 5-year period, especially with the rampant inflation the world has been facing post-Covid, but for price-sensitive McDonald's customers; a 30% price increase is a lot. McDonald's typical customer would expect prices of meals to freeze in time. Operating income decreased by 6%, and net income by 12%, reflecting absorption of the company for growing costs, and not passing on all cost increases.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">There is no particular reason why McDonald’s share price should be growing more than average – and so it does not. Share price growth over the past 12 months was only 20% - half that of the S&amp;P 500. Net income and operating cash flow generated in Q2 were stagnant compared to the previous year. Revenues only grew by 20% over the past five years. A shareholder of McDonald’s would not expect super growth but would expect stable and consistent returns.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">And so is the case; over the past five years, the company increased dividend payouts by 30% and retired US$ 12 billion of shares. Annual capital expenditures consume only a third of operating cash flows, leaving plenty of free cashflows left for shareholders payouts.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">Growth plans are ongoing, including <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/72d0f27c-1069-4099-92ec-9cad54abb22e" rel="noopener">plans to increase UK restaurants</a> by 13% from 1,435 currently to 1,635. Continuing to grow the network is essential while working to revive like-to-like sales growth of existing restaurants.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">Valuation bloated</h2> <div class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content"></div> <p class="paywall-full-content">With its incredible global reach, iconic brand, and unique operating efficiency, no one can argue that McDonald’s is not a stable and ‘safe’ business – transforming to a safe long-term investment. But the valuation today represents high growth prospects, which McDonald’s does not really demonstrate. A P/E ratio of 27.5x is higher than those of Alphabet and Meta, and equivalent to the P/E of the S&amp;P 500. A market cap to operating cash flow of 25x is very rich. If the E. coil outbreak shaves a bit more of the valuation, a more attractive entry opportunity could be in the making for potential investors. At the moment, a Hold would be an appropriate positioning for investors until the company proves it can return to comparable sales growth, profitability growth, and a more attractive valuation is on offer.</p></body></html>
